# ARMchain Governance

ARMchain operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with a robust governance framework that ensures community participation in key decisions while maintaining technical excellence and security.

## Governance Overview

### Core Principles

1. **Decentralization**: No single entity controls the network
2. **Transparency**: All proposals and votes are public
3. **Inclusivity**: All ARM token holders can participate
4. **Technical Excellence**: Decisions based on merit and research
5. **Quantum Security**: All governance mechanisms are quantum-resistant

## Voting Process

### Proposal Lifecycle

#### 1. Proposal Creation
Anyone holding at least 1,000 ARM tokens can create a proposal.

**Proposal Types:**
- **Protocol Upgrades**: Core protocol changes
- **Parameter Changes**: Adjusting system parameters
- **Treasury Spending**: Allocation of community funds
- **Grant Programs**: Funding for ecosystem development
- **Emergency Actions**: Critical security measures

#### 2. Discussion Period
- Duration: 7 days
- Community discussion on forums and Discord
- Technical review by experts
- Proposal refinement based on feedback

#### 3. Voting Period
- Duration: 14 days
- Quantum-safe voting mechanism
- Delegated voting allowed
- Quadratic voting for some proposal types

#### 4. Implementation
- Successful proposals automatically execute via smart contracts
- Protocol upgrades require additional security reviews
- Emergency proposals can have expedited timelines

### Voting Mechanisms

#### Direct Voting
Token holders vote directly on proposals:

```javascript
// Quantum-safe voting contract
contract QuantumVoting {
    struct Vote {
        address voter;
        uint256 weight;
        bool support;
        bytes quantumSignature;
    }

    function castVote(
        uint256 proposalId,
        bool support,
        bytes memory quantumSignature
    ) external {
        require(verifyQuantumSignature(msg.sender, quantumSignature), "Invalid signature");
        require(!hasVoted[proposalId][msg.sender], "Already voted");

        uint256 votingPower = getVotingPower(msg.sender);
        votes[proposalId].push(Vote({
            voter: msg.sender,
            weight: votingPower,
            support: support,
            quantumSignature: quantumSignature
        }));

        hasVoted[proposalId][msg.sender] = true;
        emit VoteCast(msg.sender, proposalId, support, votingPower);
    }
}
```

#### Delegated Voting
Token holders can delegate their voting power:

```javascript
function delegateVote(address delegate, bytes memory quantumSignature) external {
    require(verifyQuantumSignature(msg.sender, quantumSignature), "Invalid signature");
    delegates[msg.sender] = delegate;
    emit VoteDelegated(msg.sender, delegate);
}
```

#### Quadratic Voting
For certain proposals, quadratic voting prevents wealth concentration:

```
Voting Power = sqrt(Token Balance)
```

### Voting Power Calculation

**Base Formula:**
```
Voting Power = Token Balance × Time Multiplier × Participation Bonus

Where:
- Time Multiplier: 1 + (stake_duration_months / 12) × 0.5
- Participation Bonus: 1 + (governance_participation_rate × 0.2)
```

**Example:**
```
Token Balance: 10,000 ARM
Stake Duration: 6 months
Participation Rate: 80%

Voting Power = 10,000 × (1 + 6/12 × 0.5) × (1 + 0.8 × 0.2)
             = 10,000 × 1.25 × 1.16
             = 14,500
```
